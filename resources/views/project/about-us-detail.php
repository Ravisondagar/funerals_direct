					<h2>Lance and Lessah Murray</h2>
					<p>Lance is a qualified Embalmer/Funeral Director who has worked actively in the funeral industry from the age of 14. He was raised around and even lived above several of the Funeral homes operated by his family. Lance attributes his passion for the funeral industry to his father Tom Murray Jnr who is recognised as being the first Māori to work in the funeral industry and the first Māori to own and operate his own funeral home (Murray’s and Shepherds Ltd, Auckland). Lance has worked in both Australia and New Zealand and has owned and managed funeral homes in the Far North, Auckland, Hamilton and Hastings. This has provided Lance with an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the industry and the challenges that families are faced with at this time of need.</p>
					<p>His wife Leesah is just as passionate about the new journey that awaits them both. She is currently an Executive Director for a tertiary organisation, which includes all areas across the organisation’s operations from governance, executive management, strategy, performance, legal and quality. Leesah holds a MBA and a Bachelor of Environmental Management, however she enjoys the challenges associated with normalising the funeral industry. This can be achieved by creating a level of acceptance by the public to understanding the industry standards, ethics and basic processes. The general public often fears the industry and Leesah wants to help educate people so that they are more aware of the high standards to be expected when their loved one is being cared for by a Funeral Home.</p>
					<p>Together, Lance and Leesah have the balance of funeral insights and business know-how to leverage their passion and commitment to create a platform for families to engage with funerals homes.</p>
					<p>Recently they sold their funeral home in the Waikato, Simplicity Bereavement Services and are grateful for the support they have had from the Waikato community for the past 17 years. The journey has been one of reflection; reciprocity and relationships and both Lance and Leesah look forward to removing the stigma of the funeral industry and bringing family’s funeral packages that suit their situation and needs.</p>
